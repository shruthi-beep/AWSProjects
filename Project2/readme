# VPC+EC2+Internet Gateway(IG)+Security Groups (SG)
1. Created a VPC with 2 subnets (1. Public 2. Private)
2. Created an Internet Gateway. Updated it's routing table to give internet access.
3. Created 2 different routing tables for 2 subnets and attached one for each.
4. Edit public subnet routing table to attach internet gateway access. This way we can make this subnet public.
5. Launched 2 ec2 instances one in each subnet.
6. Edit Private subnet  ec2 security group to allow access only from public subnet ec2 IP.
7. Edit public subnet ec2 security group to allow access from port no: 80
7. SSH into each public ec2 instance and install apache web server and start the service(sudo yum install httpd). Log into private ec2 instance internally from this and install apache.
8. update index.html page located in /var/www/html to print hellow world message.


Testing:
1. Try accessing public ec2 instance in browser using public IP---gets success as you allowed traffic on port 80
2. Try accessing private ec2 instance in browser using public IP---fails as you only allowed traffic from public ec2 instance.
